=== The Slice Type

Slice is a datatype that lets you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection in an immutable or mutable manner.
It does not have the notion of ownership.

[NOTE]
====
String literals of type "str" are stored in binary.
----
let s = "Hello, world!";
----
creates *s*, a slice i,e, a reference to contiguous sequence of elements in binary, which contains the string "Hello, world!"
