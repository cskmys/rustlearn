=== Concise control flow with *if let*

Lets you combine *if* and *let* to perform pattern matching in a less verbose way.

It is suitable for situations when you want to do something on a particular pattern match and do nothing or something else for the rest.
It can be seen as combining *if* or *if-else* with pattern matching.
Therefore, with this construct you can write concise code but trade off is that you can only match one type of pattern.
When you want to match multiple types, you'll have to write a more verbose version with *match* construct.


[WARNING]
====
When a variable matches a pattern and is bound to the pattern, it can be moved or copied based on whether it's a primitive data type or complex data type
