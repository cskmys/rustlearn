=== Packages and Crates

A *crate* is a tree of modules that produces a library or an executable.
Every crate has *root* module which is the source file that rust compiler starts from.
For binary crate `src/main.rs` is the root file and for library crate `src/lib.rs` is the root file.

A *package* is set of one or more binary crates and optionally one library crate to provide a set of functionality.
Each package contains a `Cargo.toml` that describes how to build its crates.
Package rules:

* A package must have at least on crate
* A package can have any number of binary crates
* A package can at most have only one library crate

A package root is the crate root of the crate with the same name as the package.
To add binary crates to a package as non-root, place crate root of each of binary crates in `src/bin`.

While using an external package in your project, scope will be helpful to prevent name conflicts.
