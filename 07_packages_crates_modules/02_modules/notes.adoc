=== Defining *modules* to control scope and privacy

Within a crate, *modules* lets us organize code into groups for readability and easy reuse.
Modules also control privacy of items by allowing/blocking a particular code to be used by outside code.

Modules can be nested, and they can hold functions, structs, enums, constants, traits.
It is very similar to filesystem consisting of folders and files.
Here modules can be seen as folders and everything it can hold inside as files.
Hence, we can say that a crate has a modulesystem.
Just like the root directory of unix system, the crate root which is the `src/main.rs` file for binary crate and `src/lib.rs` file for library crate forms the root module.
