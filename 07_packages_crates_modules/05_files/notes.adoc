=== Separating modules into different files

When modules get large you might want to move their definitions to a separate file to make code easier to navigate.
Rust equivalent of *C* language's include statement is:
----
use <module_name>;
----
using `;` instead of `{` means that content of module needs to loaded from another file.
If this is in crate root module, module is searched for in file `<module_name>.rs` under `src` folder.
If this was in non-root module, then module is searched for in file `<module_name>.rs` under `<module_parent>` folder under `src` folder.
