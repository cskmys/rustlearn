== Writing Automated Tests

Correctness of a program is the extent to which a program does what it is intended to do.

Program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but it is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence.

Rust with its type system and borrow checker etc. is highly geared towards correctness of a program.
It even has language level support for writing automated software tests

Rust provides means to assert a function's output for a given input.
These can be used to create automated tests that can be run every time after making code changes,
