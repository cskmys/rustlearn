=== Hello, Cargo!

==== Cargo Commands
===== Create a new project
----
cargo new <project>
----
In the directory where you ran the command, this will create:
[filetree]
* `<project>/`
** `Cargo.toml`
** `src/`
*** `main.rs`

[WARNING]
====
Except this command, all other cargo commands are executed inside `<project>/` where `Cargo.toml` resides.
====

===== Build
----
cargo build
----
Inside `<project>/`, this will generate:
[filetree]
* `target/`
** `debug`
*** `<project>` (your executable)
*** Some files and folders
* `Cargo.lock` (don't ever edit it)

===== Build and Run
----
cargo run
----
If there is no code change it won't build but will just run

===== Check
This is build but without generating the executable.
----
cargo check
----
Way faster than generating executable and can be used continuously while coding to check the code

===== Build for Release
Takes longer as it includes optimizations
----
cargo build --release
----
Inside `<target>/`, this will generate:
[filetree]
* `release/`
** `<project>` (release version of your executable)
** Some files and folders
