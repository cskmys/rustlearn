=== Functions

A function can contain statements and expressions.
Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value(meaning returns a unit type `()` which means nothing).
Expressions evaluate to a resulting value.
A statement can contain an expression.

Unlike *C*, rust doesn't expect forward declaration of functions.
Functions can reside anywhere in the program.

In function signature you must declare the type for every parameter.
Hence, the compiler doesn't require you to use a function somewhere in the code to infer the arguments' type.

A function where body ends with an expression will return a value while a function where body ends with a statement doesn't.
