=== Storing lists of values with `vector`

Vectors allow storing multiple values of same type under a single data structure in a contiguous memory location.
Useful for list of items.

Though a vector need not know the number of elements at compile time, it will still need to know the size of an element at compile time.

[TIP]
====
To make a vector hold data of different types, you can create an enum whose variants are of different types and then create a vector that would hold data of this enum type.
