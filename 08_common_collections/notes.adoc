== Common Collections

The standard library contains a number of useful data structures called *collections*.
Unlike built-in array and tuple types, its size need not be known at compile time which means they can dynamically grow or shrink.
Hence, the data they point to is on the heap.

3 commonly used collections are:

* `vector`
* `String`
* `hashmap`
