=== The `match` control flow operator

`match` is extremely powerful control flow operator that can compare a value against series of patterns and execute code based on the match.
These patterns are very expressive, and it can be literal values, variable names, wildcards etc.
When patterns are used, rust compiler exhaustively checks for coverage and makes sure all the cases are handled.
[NOTE]
====
This forces you to handle `None` cases in `Option<T>` instead of assuming something.
This eliminates all the unexpected behaviors associated with `Null` in other languages in rust.
====

The comparison happens in order and the code under first match gets executed.

[WARNING]
====
When a variable matches a pattern and is bound to the pattern, it can be moved or copied based on whether it's a primitive data type or complex data type
