== Functional language features: Iterators and Closures

Functional programming often includes using functions as values by passing them in arguments, returning them from other functions, assigning them to variables for later execution etc.
Iterators and closures are the key foundation to doing this.

=== Loops vs Iterators
The intuitive assumption might be that the more low-level loop will be faster than the code with iterators.
Iterators although a high-level abstraction gets compiled down to roughly same as the lower level code written by hand.
Rust follows zero-overhead principle from *C++*:

What you don’t use, you don’t pay for.
And further: What you do use, you couldn’t hand code any better.
