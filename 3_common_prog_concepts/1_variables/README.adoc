=== Variables and Mutability

Default immutability of variables is not limiting, in fact, it works to our advantage.
When a variable is declared as immutable, we never have to worry about it being changed from any other part of the code(or any other thread).
This compiler guarantee saves us time lost in bug fixes that involves tracking down if and from where the variable is being changed.

Shadowing is not a substitute to creating a mutable variable.
Shadowing is just re-use of a variable name, and a shadowed variable can have a different data type from the one that it shadows.
