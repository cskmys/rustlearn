=== Unrecoverable errors with *panic!*

Sometimes there is no way to recover from an error/unexpected malfunction in code.
In these cases you can execute a *panic!* macro to print a failure message, unwind, clean up the stack and quit.
[NOTE]
====
Unwinding means walking back up the stack, cleaning up the data from each function in call stack.
====
Alternatively, you can choose to immediately abort without cleaning up the stack in which case memory cleanup will be done by operating system.
To configure program to abort on *panic!* in *release* mode, in your *Cargo.toml* you can do:
----
[profile.release]
panic = 'abort'
----
[NOTE]
====
Abort produces a smaller binary size compared to default panic.
====

To see the whole call stack(backtrace) during panic, run the command:
----
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run
----
Using the call stack you can find the point in code which is causing the panic.
