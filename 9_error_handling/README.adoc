== Error Handling

Rust has a number of features for error handling.
In many cases rust forces you to take actions for a potential error before successful compilation.

2 categories:

* recoverable: retry again and/or continue
* unrecoverable: stop the execution

Rust doesn't have exceptions rather *Result<T, E>* for recoverable errors and *panic!* macro for unrecoverable errors
